Stream Wrapper API provides the core foundation upon which wrappers for WordPress are built.

== Description ==

Stream Wrapper API provides the core foundation upon which PHP5+ stream wrappers for WordPress are built.
This plugin by itself provides little to no user visible functionality. Instead, most use comes from
other wrapper implementation plugins. For example, check out the YouTube and Amazon S3 wrappers [coming soon].
