WP Stream Wrappers provides the core foundation upon which wrappers for
WordPress are built.

== Description ==

WP Stream Wrappers provides the core foundation upon which PHP5+ 
stream wrappers for WordPress are built. This plugin by itself
provides little to no user visible functionality. Rather, most use
comes from other wrapper implementation plugins.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the 'wp-stream-wrappers' directory to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory.
