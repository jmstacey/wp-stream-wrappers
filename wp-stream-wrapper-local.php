 * This file contains the wp-content WordPress Stream Wrapper which implements
 * the "local://" scheme. This is a simple and complete stream wrapper
 * implementation for testing, reference, and extension purposes. Other stream
 * wrappers that manipulate files on the local filesystem can quickly extend
 * this class to suit more specific needs. The WP Test [test://] stream
 * is an excellent example of this use case.
